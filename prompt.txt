I want to build a full-stack Personal Finance Manager web app with the following features:

ðŸ”¹ Core Features:
1. Add expenses with description, amount, date, and category (Food, Travel, Shopping, Others).
2. Add income (simple form for pocket money, allowance, gifts).
3. Display all transactions (income + expenses) in a unified list.
4. Show a dashboard summary:
   - Total Income
   - Total Expenses
   - Remaining Balance (Income â€“ Expenses)
5. Expense-focused reports:
   - Pie chart â†’ Expenses by category
   - Bar/Line chart â†’ Expenses vs Income over time
   - Balance progress bar showing how much of pocket money is left
   - Insights: biggest expense category, monthly savings/overspending
6. Budget tracking:
   - User sets monthly spending budget
   - Alerts at 70%, 100%, over budget
7. Export reports (CSV and PDF)

ðŸ”¹ Advanced Features:
- User accounts (email + password login with JWT authentication).
- Recurring expenses (like subscriptions).
- Dark mode toggle.
- Responsive mobile-friendly layout.
- Save all data to MongoDB.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Hook Form + Yup (validation), Recharts (charts).
- Backend: Node.js + Express, MongoDB with Mongoose.
- Authentication: JWT.
- Reports Export: json2csv for CSV, jspdf for PDF.

ðŸ”¹ Database Models:
User:
- id
- name
- email
- password (hashed)

Transaction:
- id
- userId
- type (income | expense)
- description
- amount
- category
- date

Now, generate the code step by step:
1. Setup project structure (frontend + backend).
2. Implement backend APIs for user auth (register/login), add transaction, fetch transactions, delete transaction.
3. Implement frontend pages:
   - Login/Register
   - Dashboard with summary + charts
   - Transaction list (filter, search, delete, edit)
   - Add Transaction form
   - Reports page (charts + export CSV/PDF)
4. Style everything with Tailwind for a clean modern UI.
5. Integrate Recharts for visualization.
6. Implement PDF/CSV export for reports.
